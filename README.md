This frontend website was designed to illustrate my current experience in web development

The objectives are to:<br>
1 - provide a web presence to potential employers and those seeking project work;<br>
2 - attract potential employers;<br>
3 - showcase my experience and education so far;<br>
4 - maintain consistent branding across the webpages;<br>
5 - provide contact information for potential employers and to link to my social media (LinkedIn)

### User Stories
As well as accommodating my objectives consideration has been given to the needs of prospective users of the website:

#### Potential Employers
- I would like to:
    - contact Anne for information<br>
    - gain an understanding of this individual's skills<br>
    - understand the level of this individual's technical ability<br>

### Purpose
This website is designed as a front-end only website to achieve the above, in a unique style. The site contains 3 pages with links to each page accessed from a central animated menu bar that indicates clearly with a hover over effect which link is available for selection. <br>
Each of the pages centres of one of my main objectives:

- Home - contact information, overview of personal information, aims and benefit for the potential employer.
- Resume - overview of employment history and technical skills achieved through education<br>
- Contact - clear contact information for potential employers.

The CV link provides a straightforward download link for potential employers of my CV in pdf format.

My branding empahsises deep blue/purple colouring with maroon and deep beige highlights across all pages.<br>
Animated hover effects on links enable users to clearly identify what elements of the page are links and provide some interactivity for the user experience. <br>

## Testing
Code was written through the Cloud9 IDE and VSCode Studio.
The website has been tested on IE, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera browsers.

## Deployment
A repository was created through the GitHub console under folder CV.<br>
The project, developed through the Cloud9 IDE and VSCode was then commited to the GitHub repository using standard terminal commit and push commands.<br>
Commits were made at each major development stage or as issues were identified and fixed.<br>
The project was then deployed to GitHub pages through the GitHub online console using the following steps:<br>
- Through the console settings tab the master branch was set to the default branch<br>
- The master branch was then selected as the source for GitHub pages and the settings saved<br>

To edit/run the code locally it is necessary to pull the code from the GitHub repository. This can be achieved through the GitHub console using the following steps: 
- Navigate to the main page of the repository
- Click 'clone/download' under the repository name
- To clone with HTTPS click the copy icon to copy the URL for the repository
- Locally open Git Bash and navigate the working directory to the location where the repository should be cloned
- Use the git clone command and paste the cloned URL.
<br>
- Alternatively, directly through Git Bash type the command:<br>
      $git clone https://github/Shilldon/CV.git

There are no differences between the development and deployed versions.<br>
Other than a standard browser no further software or implementation is required and a link is provided on GitHub Pages.<br>
